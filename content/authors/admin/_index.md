I am a biostatistician at Ora, Inc., a contract research organization specializing in ophthalmology studies, where I lead statistical analyses for early to mid phase clinical trials, including studies on dry eye disease and retinitis pigmentosa. I am responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, developing statistical analysis plans, and coordinating with large, cross-functional teams, including one based in Hyderabad, India. I oversee the creation of key datasets, summaries, and graphical representations for clinical trial data, while maintaining a focus on data integrity, quality control, and timely project execution. Additionally, I represent the Statistical Operations Department at various regulatory and sponsor meetings

I graduated from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill where I received my B.S. in Statistics and Analytics and a minor in Data Science. I went on to receive my Master of Statistics from North Carolina State University, but I am still a Tarheel at heart!

I specialize in SAS and SQL, but I am also proficient with the R coding language for building models, analyzing complex datasets, and creating visualizations. I am currently working towards proficiency in Python in an effort to expand my working toolbox.
