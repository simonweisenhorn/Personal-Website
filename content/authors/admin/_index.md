I am a student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, studying statistics and analytics with a minor in data science.

I have a passion for biostatistics and enjoy seeing how different sources of data can reveal compelling conclusions for new drugs.

I specialize in the SAS coding language to analyze datasets and bridge the gap between pharmaceutical companies and statistics. I am also knowledgeable with the R coding language for building models and graphics.
