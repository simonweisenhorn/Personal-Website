I am a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill where I received my B.S. in Statistics and Analytics and a minor in Data Science. Now, I am currently a Master of Statistics candidate from North Carolina State University.

I have a passion for biostatistics and enjoy seeing how different sources of data can reveal compelling conclusions for new drugs.

I specialize in the SAS coding language to analyze datasets and bridge the gap between pharmaceutical companies and statistics. I am also proficient with the R coding language for building models, analyzing complex datasets, and creating visualizations.
